# HTB Labs Writeups

This repository contains my personal notes and write-ups from HTB labs. I use it to document what I learn while practicing hands-on cybersecurity skills, focusing on how vulnerabilities are identified, exploited at a high level, and how they could be prevented in real environments.

> Detailed step-by-step lab notes are maintained privately and are not published here.
