# Hack The Box – Starting Point (Tier 0)

## Overview
Starting Point is where I began my hands-on journey into cybersecurity using Hack The Box.  
This section focuses on learning the fundamentals of offensive security in a guided and beginner-friendly way.

The labs in this tier are designed to help new learners understand how to connect to Hack The Box, perform basic enumeration, and interact with simple network services.

## Purpose
The goal of this tier is not exploitation depth, but **building confidence and foundational skills**, such as:
- Understanding how target machines are accessed
- Identifying exposed services
- Recognizing common misconfigurations
- Learning how attackers think at a basic level

Each machine typically involves a single, clear objective and provides guidance to help reinforce learning.

## What I Document Here
In this folder, I document:
- My thought process while approaching each lab
- Key concepts introduced by the machine
- High-level explanations of vulnerabilities
- Security lessons and basic mitigation ideas

I intentionally avoid sharing flags, credentials, or step-by-step exploit commands.

## Skills Practiced
- Basic network and service enumeration
- Interacting with common services (HTTP, FTP, SMB, etc.)
- Reading and understanding lab hints
- Developing a structured testing mindset

## Learning Outcome
Completing the Starting Point labs helped me build a strong foundation before moving on to more complex Hack The Box machines, and gave me a clearer understanding of how real-world systems can be misconfigured or exposed.
